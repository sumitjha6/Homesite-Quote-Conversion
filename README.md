# Homesite-Quote-Conversion
Homesite a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase. In this Kaggle problem we will predict which customers will purchase a given quote. We have used multiple classifiers 
for prediction and used these predictions to build a new model using stacking.Here in order to handle imbalanced data, we have used SMOTE.
